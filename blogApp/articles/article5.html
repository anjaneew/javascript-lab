    <h1>Planting Calm in a Busy Life</h1>
    <h3>06 June 2025</h3>
<p>In the middle of coding, writing, and learning, I pause to water my plants. These pauses aren’t breaks—they’re therapy. Nurturing something with no deadlines resets my energy and focus.</p>

<p>When I sit at my desk for long hours, my eyes drift to my green companions. A quick misting or a glance at a new sprout is enough to shift my mood. It’s a slow rhythm that contrasts my fast-paced digital life. Plants teach me to breathe deeper, slow down, and stay present.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in between intense study sessions, I get up and repot a plant. It might seem like procrastination, but it’s a kind of reset. Touching soil, trimming dead leaves, noticing small growth—it reminds me that everything moves in cycles, not straight lines.</p>

<p>When stress builds up, I light incense and sit among my plants. Their presence alone calms me. I’ve realized that tending to them helps me tend to myself. They don’t ask for much, just consistency, light, and water. But in giving that, I receive calm, clarity, and a little joy.</p>
