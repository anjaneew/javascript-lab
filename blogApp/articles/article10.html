    <h1>Growing with garden</h1>
    <h3>06 June 2025</h3>
<p>Growing with My Plants, every new leaf is a milestone. Every repotted plant is progress. As I learn JavaScript and rebuild my life, these green companions remind me that growth takes time. We grow together, leaf by leaf.</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s frustrating. A plant stops growing, or I overwater. It mirrors the moments when my code doesn’t work or motivation dips. But we try again. Adjust lighting, change approach, give time. And slowly, things start to shift.</p>

<p>These plants have seen me through all moods—hopeful, tired, excited, anxious. I’ve cried while holding a drooping leaf. I’ve smiled at the sight of a new sprout. My journey is rooted in their quiet company.</p>

<p>Watching something grow in silence reminds me to trust my own process. It doesn’t have to be loud or fast to be meaningful. Each leaf, each learning moment, is part of the bigger bloom I’m becoming.</p>
