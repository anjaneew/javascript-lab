    <h1>Tiny Leaves, Big Peace</h1>
    <h3>06 June 2025</h3>
<p>Each morning, I check my plants before anything else. Even before brushing my teeth, I walk to the windowsill and scan for change. A new leaf, a slight tilt toward the sun, or dry soil. These tiny observations ground me.</p>

<p>There's something uniquely calming about tending to plants. They don't speak, yet they communicate through posture, color, and growth. I used to overlook small details in life, but with plants, details matter. I started noticing how the light moves across my room, when the air feels dry, how much water is too much.</p>

<p>My peace lily is my favorite. It was droopy when I got it, almost lifeless. Slowly, with care, it stood tall again. That transformation filled me with unexpected joy. It taught me that quiet, consistent love works wonders—not just for plants, but for people, too.</p>

<p>In a life filled with screen time, deadlines, and isolation, plants give me a living, breathing balance. They don't rush. They grow when they’re ready. They show me the value of slowing down. Every new leaf feels like a gentle affirmation: progress is happening, even if it's slow.</p>

<p>I keep a tiny notebook just for plant observations. It sounds silly, but it's become a peaceful routine. I write when leaves appear, when I prune, when I re-pot. Tracking their growth reminds me to track my own.</p>

<p>These tiny leaves aren’t just greenery. They are a mirror of my inner world. When I feel anxious, they remind me that I’m growing, even if I don’t see it right away. Big peace, I’ve learned, often comes from the tiniest things.</p>
