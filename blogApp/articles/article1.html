    <h1>Green Corners of My Hostel Room</h1>
    <h3>06 June 2025</h3>
<p>Living in a small hostel room doesn’t stop me from nurturing life. Every corner of my space hosts a plant: a snake plant near the window, tiny succulents by my desk, and a pothos trailing from a shelf. They soften the sterile walls and fill my room with quiet, green resilience.</p>

<p>At first, I thought I wouldn’t have the space or time to manage plants. But the moment I added one, the atmosphere shifted. It was like having company—a silent companion that needed gentle care. I began to understand how much life a single plant could bring to a confined space. Slowly, the number of plants grew. Each one had a purpose: some for air purification, others simply for joy.</p>

<p>My snake plant is the easiest. It thrives on neglect, a symbol of endurance. The pothos, in contrast, demands attention and frequent watering, but it rewards me with rapid, vibrant growth. The succulents are tricky. They remind me to respect boundaries—they need light, not love.</p>

<p>Watering days have become moments of pause. I put on soft music, open the window, and spend a few minutes with each plant. It feels less like a task and more like meditation. In return, my plants make my room breathable, not just in oxygen but in energy.</p>

<p>Gardening in a hostel room means thinking creatively. I use recycled jars, old mugs, even yogurt cups as pots. I hang plants from curtain rods and use wall shelves for display. It's not just about aesthetics; it's about reclaiming space for peace.</p>

<p>These green corners are now my favorite parts of the room. They reflect my inner state—calm, hopeful, growing. Even in this small room, surrounded by walls and limits, my plants remind me there is always room for life, color, and healing.</p>
