    <h1>Rooted in Routine</h1>
    <h3>06 June 2025</h3>
<p>My Garden Days I have a plant-care schedule: Mondays are for misting, Thursdays for watering, Sundays for soil checks. This structure stabilizes my week. It’s simple but grounding. The roots I tend in soil mirror the roots I’m growing in life.</p>

<p>Having a schedule gives me rhythm. In a world where days blur together, these small tasks give me milestones. On Sunday, I clean leaves with a damp cloth. On Thursday, I check if the new pot needs drainage. It’s predictable in the best way.</p>

<p>When I feel unproductive or lost, I do something for my plants. I trim, I replant, I rearrange. Even these tiny acts feel like progress. They remind me that care is a kind of productivity, too.</p>

<p>The routine has also taught me to listen more closely—to my plants, to my environment, to myself. A yellowing leaf may mean overwatering. A wilted plant may be root-bound. These signs now feel like a secret language I’ve come to understand.</p>

<p>Rooted in this gentle, predictable care, I’ve found unexpected strength. The act of showing up for my plants has become a practice in showing up for my own life.</p>
