    <h1> Gardening Alone but Not Lonely</h1>
    <h3>06 June 2025</h3>
<p>Caring for plants fills a silence that doesn’t feel empty. I talk to my plants. I name them. They don’t reply, but they respond. A new leaf, a subtle bloom—these are their quiet conversations with me.</p>

<p>Living alone in a hostel can feel isolating. But when I’m surrounded by plants, I feel less alone. They offer companionship without pressure. I share my thoughts while watering, sometimes even frustrations. And in return, they offer stillness.</p>

<p>Some nights I sit in the dark, just watching them. Their silhouettes under moonlight are calming. In those moments, I feel held by something beyond language. My plants don’t solve problems, but they anchor me.</p>

<p>They remind me that being alone doesn’t mean being disconnected. There’s life around me, and it listens.</p>
