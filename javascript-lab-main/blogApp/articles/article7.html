    <h1>Sunlight, Soil, and Self-Care</h1>
    <h3>06 June 2025</h3>
<p>Plants need light, water, and nutrients. So do I. This reminder helps me take better care of myself. When my fern wilts, I check if I’ve also neglected my own needs. Self-care often starts with plant care.</p>

<p>Tending to plants is more than a hobby; it's a mirror. If a plant is drooping, I ask myself, have I been resting enough? If the leaves are burned, I think, have I overexposed myself to stress? These reflections make me pause and adjust.</p>

<p>There’s also a tactile comfort in the process. Feeling soil, watching roots, seeing new shoots appear—it grounds me. Some evenings, when the light is soft and golden, I just sit with them. That quiet moment becomes an act of nourishment for both of us.</p>

<p>Watering my plants has replaced mindless scrolling. Trimming leaves has replaced anxious fidgeting. It’s not a cure, but it is a support system. Nature has its own gentle way of guiding us back to ourselves.</p>
