    <h1>From Soil to Soul</h1>
    <h3>06 June 2025</h3>
<p>I didn’t always love plants. My journey began during a difficult time, when I was emotionally drained and mentally exhausted. I bought a small aloe vera on a whim, thinking it might make my room look nicer. I didn’t know it would become a turning point.</p>

<p>At first, I struggled even to remember watering it. But I noticed something: the days I cared for the aloe were the days I felt a little better. That small act of nurturing something else gave me a reason to pause and breathe. It became a ritual, a moment of connection to life beyond my stress.</p>

<p>Soon, I added more plants. A spider plant joined the aloe, followed by a jade and a peace lily. Each new plant marked a step forward in my healing. With every new leaf, I felt lighter. Every root that settled into soil mirrored the grounding I was doing in my own life.</p>

<p>Plants taught me patience. Growth doesn’t happen overnight. Leaves die. Soil dries out. But with time and care, life finds a way. I began to see these lessons in myself. On days when I felt low, I still showed up for my plants—and eventually, I learned to show up for myself too.</p>

<p>Gardening gave me something I didn’t expect: purpose. In the silence of my room, surrounded by green, I learned that healing is a slow, deliberate process. Now, my shelf of plants isn’t just decoration. It’s a timeline of my growth, each pot holding a memory, a struggle, a win.</p>

<p>From soil to soul, this journey has grounded me. What started as decoration became therapy. My plants didn’t just grow—they transformed me, quietly and completely.</p>
