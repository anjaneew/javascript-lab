    <h1>My Little Forest Indoors</h1>
    <h3>06 June 2025</h3>
<p>With 15+ plants, my room resembles a tiny forest. Ferns, peace lilies, cacti—each has a name, a story. This indoor forest is my sanctuary. It breathes with me, listens without noise, and grows alongside me.</p>

<p>There’s something deeply soothing about being surrounded by greenery. The air feels cleaner. The colors soften the room. I’ve arranged them by height and light needs—tall ones in corners, trailing vines on shelves, and tiny ones near the bed.</p>

<p>Each plant holds a memory. The jade was a gift. The spider plant was rescued. The aloe came from a roadside vendor. Their survival feels like a shared achievement. On rough days, I sit among them and remember how far we’ve come.</p>

<p>They aren’t decoration—they’re presence. My room may be small, but this forest makes it feel alive, expansive. The rustle of a leaf, the way sunlight filters through the vines—these moments remind me that peace doesn’t need space, just intention.</p>
